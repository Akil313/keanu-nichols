Now onto my fourth blog post, I got to admit I’m actually happy I’m writing up these posts I think it gives me time to go over what I’ve done and see how much time I spent on a problem and I’m now able to see such an easier solution (always fun haha, it feels strange to use lol is it informal? who knows).

This might be a pretty long intro but let’s say I’m making up for not having posted the first few weeks when GSoC started (haha). So we have our goals as per usual now this week as expected I thought it was going to be a simple walk in the park, going to finish pretty soon but of course I was wrong. The goal I spent on the most surprisingly was on number 2 where I had to add the score to the SQL table in the database, I thought the 5 goal was going to take a good amount of time but it really just required me to think a lot and one I had that down it was easier to implement (was I just typing things and seeing what happen of course but eventually you see a pattern you know haha) (This was a long intro waw I just went on didn’t I?).</p>

<p>So this week’s task with my mentor <a href="http://www.seangoggins.net/">Sean Goggins</a> is as follows:</p>

<h1 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the week:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>setup augur.config.json parameter for loading a set of mailing Lists</li>
  <li>Do a simple sentiment analysis on each message.  <em>Perhaps keep the “score” in an additional column in the table.</em></li>
  <li>Work with @Derek, @Gabe and @Carter to get your fork merged</li>
  <li>Build a filter to disregard long attachments or included items …</li>
  <li>Experiment with ways of filtering out old message strings from subsequent messages on the mailing lists and identifying mailing list discussion threads (some lists have them automatically, some don’t) … so, when you reply to an email, it often includes the text  you are responding to … it’s about getting rid off all the prior messages before the message at the top …</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Goal 1:<br />
For this goal I first started off in the jupyter notebook PiperMail and what I’m doing is getting the path (line 3) of where the file is stored with all the mailing lists. If the file was never created the file is created but the user has to enter the mailing lists and the links for it.</p>

</figure>

<p>To get the file path we have to go back to our friend application.py which reads a file called “augur.config.json” this is used to specify what exactly the person is going to pull.</p>

<figure class="highlight">

</figure>

<p>In our case it’s this part of the file for “augur.config.json</p>

<figure class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="s2">"PiperMail"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
       <span class="s2">"mailing_lists"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"runtime/mailing_lists.csv"</span>
   <span class="p">},</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>To give you an example of how the file is supposed to be you can see it below this is in a file called “mailing_lists.csv”</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Link</th>
      <th>mail_list</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/</td>
      <td>”aalldp-dev”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/</td>
      <td>”archetypes-dev”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/</td>
      <td>”announce”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Goal 2:<br />
Now with this goal which I may need to improve on but for now it gets the job done we are going to analyse the sentences again but this time we’re going to add the score to the SQL table. We will look at “Sentiment_Piper.ipynb” the jupyter notebook seen below. Well one of the differences is that we actually get the mailing lists from the database (line 2) instead of when I was reading a json file that had the mailing lists names.</p>

   <span class="mi">1</span>  <span class="n">archetypes</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span>
   <span class="mi">2</span> </code></pre>
</figure>

<p>For the next part we will look at when I calculate the scores, now when using NLTK the way that we went about getting the scores is that we break the messages into different tokens (line 19) and we go about analysing each part. Another interesting thing is that it’s actually supposed to get a better score by doing it this way because when just analysing the message as a whole the NLP has a harder time getting a grasp of the whole message. So just to get the score of the whole message I just average the different scores for the different parts of the message. This may not be the best implementation but for now it works.</p>

<p>The next part is where we combine together the scores into a dataframe. Now here is where the real dilemma begins because I don’t know if you realize but in order to get the message I actually had to query it from the database, now I need to add a column to the table I just queried. This is where it gets tricky but from what I’ve seen I can’t simply append a column like that especially because I’m using dataframes. So my solution was to first create a dataframe with all the scores as seen below.</p>

<p>So my thought was that since I had to initially pull the table with the messages I should have just pulled the whole table instead of only taking part of it and then pulling it again but now the full table. I may need to fix that but if I do get a way to somehow just add the score column without any of that well I’ll just do that.</p>

<p>Goal 3:<br />
This will be cool to eventually do cause I kind of like getting commits on my Github account (haha) but we haven’t done this as yet, at the moment I work on a branch called <a href="https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/tree/pipermail">pipermail</a> on augur.</p>

<p>Goal 4:<br />
I haven’t started this as yet, I need to look up a bit more how I could go about doing this, but I do feel this will be an ongoing thing.</p>

<p>Goal 5:<br />
Now this was the real brain teaser I remember just sitting for awhile and just thinking about this and how I can approach this problem (no I wasn’t just lazing about but from an outside perspective it would definitely look like that haha). So the problem was that when I downloaded the mailing list emails it downloaded all the emails, now that’s great but if you want to actually do queries and analyse emails this tends to eat up a lot of memory. So I had to find a way of getting rid of the emails that were already combined in another email. Because these email have a thread going on when you reply to an email. So we head back to good old PiperMail (I do feel I need to do some name changes I keep thinking everything just sounds the same at this point lol, yes I just decided to change how I laugh it’s quite common for me). So we first look at the code below, is it a lot, yes, yes it is. To be honest as I’m writing this I’m thinking to myself crap you need to do this again because I didn’t do it for the part where I go through the updated messages instead,
but I’ll be a good programmer (well i’ll try) and create a function for it. So let’s look at what we have here, to explain this well I’m going to go with a normal example, so what happens if it’s the first email, well for this case let’s assume it has no references to other emails (sometimes it does which was surprising cause they don’t store that email).</p>

<p>So we have this try statement (line 5), we check to see if it has any references (line 6), of course it doesn’t cause it’s the first email so we go into the except section now since this is our first run through the messages “thread” and “store” was set to “None” so we just store that message. Now the next email may have a reference to the email before so we enter the try statement and “thread” is still “None” but “store” isn’t “None” but lucky for me I check to see if the “Message-ID” for store was in the current message which it was so we just store the message in “thread”. Now for the message let’s say that it’s a new message with no references, so “thread” isn’t “None” so we output that to the file and set “thread” to “None” and “store” is set to the new message. Now I could go through the different scenarios but I really don’t, however I can assure that it worked, well I tried it and I went through a bunch of messages and they were all there and it skipped the messages that were repeated so hopefully it’s fine. I do believe it met the criteria though but you know sometimes you need people to test it for you so overtime I hope to get some feedback. Also at the end of the loop (line 40) say we had a new message with no references then actually it wouldn’t output it to a file so I actually had to do a check and output that last message.</p>
