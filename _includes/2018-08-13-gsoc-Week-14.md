(If you've heard of [Terrace House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_House:_Opening_New_Doors) you might think I'm stealing the name but I'll say I'm showing my appreciation for the show lol)
<br><br>
So this is my final blog entry for GSoC (Google Summer of Code) (by now you really should know what that stands for but I'm a stickler for detail), wow it really has been around 4 months. Well I can say it has been a definite pleasure and don't worry I don't plan on stopping making blog entries because I still do plan on contributing to [CHAOSS](). I even have my new assignment to work on, I will try to keep doing writing on what I've been doing but it may not be every week. Also I can't forget to thank my mentor [Sean]() he really was just very helpful and understanding, I do hope he will be able to mentor other students for GSoC because they will learn a lot from this experience.

Now for this week's blog entry we actually will be learning about how to go about running my code. There is an order as to how you go about running my code so let's see if we can get this stuff running. I will be doing this guide as if I was going to run it which is on Ubuntu 16.04. You will most likely have to install some other libraries and I also had access to a ready made Database. There are other guides for OS X and Fedora but on Windows it may be a bit challenging (so I suggest just joining the fun side and join [Tux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)) aka get a Linux OS)

## Installation:
I will give the link as to where the [instructions](https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/blob/master/docs/dev-install.md) are to setup augur on your computer. First you install the dependencies. 
[Please note](#Note)

{% highlight markdown %}

#### <a name="Ubuntu">Ubuntu Dependency Installation Instructions</a>

# Install NodeSource
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -

# Install NodeJS
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install MariaDB (if needed on the same machine for the GHTorrent/msr14 dataset)
sudo apt-get install -y mariadb-server

# Install Anaconda
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh > Anaconda.sh
chmod +x Anaconda.sh

# You must agree to Anaconda's license terms to proceed
./Anaconda.sh -b
rm Anaconda.sh

# [Install Augur](#Install)

{% endhighlight %}

<br>

Then you go about actually installing Augur onto your computer. 

<span id="Note" style="color:green;">(**Note we will be doing checkout on 'pipermail' not 'dev'**)</span>

{% highlight markdown %}

## <a name="Install">Augur Installation Instructions</a>

Clone the repo and install the libraries and tools needed by Augur

git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/

## Assume you are in the root from which you cloned augur

cd augur  ## To get into the project directory root

cd augur ## To get into the augur directory under the augur root, where the make files live

# If you are going to do active development, please use the dev branch
git checkout pipermail


# Install the Python and Node tools and libraries needed
make install-dev-admin # some libraries require a root install.  

# Ignore node-pre-gyp install errors asking for cairo library or install cairo library. Augur works either way. 


{% endhighlight %}

You will then need to generate the augur.cfg file.

{% highlight markdown %}
**Augur runs in an Anaconda environment. To get started, you need to run 'augur' to create the augur.cfg file**

conda activate augur
augur

Edit the augur.cfg file with the the required information for database and API connections. 

For all the API's and visualiazations to work, you will need to include: 

- A [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/) API Key, 
- A [PublicWWW](https://publicwww.com/) API Key, and 
- A [LibrariesIO](https://libraries.io/) API Key.

You **CAN** get off the ground without those API keys though. 

**You're ready to rock! To start both the frontend and backend, run:**

 make dev
{% endhighlight %}

You will also need to generate augur.cfg.json to run most of my code

{% highlight markdown %}
make to-json
{% endhighlight%}

Next we go about running jupyter notebooks

{% highlight markdown %}
make jupyter
{% endhighlight %}

It will then look like the picture below

Now the notes that I worked on were:
-PiperMail
-Sentiment_Piper
-github-issues
-github_issues_scores
-github_pull_requests
-github_pull_requests_score
